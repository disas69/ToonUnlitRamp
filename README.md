# Toon Unlit Shader (with procedural ramp)

**The shader works with Standard RP only**

It supports single directional light and imitates ambient, specular and rim light. It also supports shadows cast by other game objects!


Instead of the commonly used ramp texture, there is a procedural ramp. You can customize it however you want using the material inspector.
